title: Overview
---

This is the reference documentation for fRPCs generated Client and Server. Since fRPC currently only supports the [Go](https://golang.org) programming language, this reference guide is currently only for [Go](https://golang.org).

This guide describes the code generated with the `protoc-gen-go-frpc` plugin, when compiling `.proto` files with protoc.

<Note>
  Client-side RPC invocations and server-side RPC handlers are meant to be
  thread-safe and will be run in concurrent goroutines. You must keep
  thread-safety in mind when implementing server-side RPC handlers for fRPC.
