# fRPC Documentation

fRPC[^1] is a **proto3-compatible** RPC Framework
that's designed from the ground up to be **lightweight, extensible, and extremely
performant**. On average fRPC outperforms other RPC frameworks [by 2-4x in an apples-to-apples
comparison](/performance/grpc-benchmarks), and is easily able to handle more than
2 million RPCs/second on a single server.
